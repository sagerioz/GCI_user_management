## Simple React Application using Flux
Create a simple user management application using React and Flux.

* Acceptance criteria:
* Displays a list of users using JSX
* Can add and remove users
* Can update existing user information
* User info includes
* First name
* Last name
* Address
* Has a basic UI (something more than unformatted text on a screen)

User data should be maintained in the store, and modified through actions. It does not have to persist outside of the application (no external JSON files or endpoints necessary).

We’re looking for an understanding of:
* How to use React’s state and props
* The React and Flux lifecycles
* ES6 Javascript
